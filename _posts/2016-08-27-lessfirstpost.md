  When I first heard about The GRID project, I knew it would be a great help to
  personalize our web presence. Now, I´m glad to see it working, true case of AI
  helping humans… Before they do with us all. This is the very first version of
  a website covering AI, robots, coffe, beer, software… General Technology.
  Enjoy!
